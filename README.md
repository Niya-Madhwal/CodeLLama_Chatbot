PowerShell & Bash Script Assistant
Overview

PowerShell & Bash Script Assistant is an intelligent coding assistant designed specifically for IT admins and support teams in corporate environments. It provides precise, ready-to-use PowerShell scripts (for Windows) and Bash commands/scripts (for Mac/Linux), with a strict emphasis on safety and compliance.

Only generates PowerShell or Bash code

Ensures scripts are safe for corporate-owned, managed devices

Never provides code that could delete, modify, or access personal user data

Ideal for managed devices where IT is controlled by a third-party provider

Key Features

Safety First:
All generated scripts avoid accessing, modifying, or deleting any files in user home directories, such as Desktop, Documents, Downloads, Pictures, etc.

Strict Scope:
Only responds to requests directly related to PowerShell scripting for Windows or Bash scripting for Mac/Linux. Any unrelated requests are politely declined.

Use Case Focus:
Designed for system diagnostics, device management, automation, and reporting tasks suitable for corporate/enterprise environments.

Clear Documentation:
All scripts include explanatory comments for easier understanding and auditing.

Usage

Ask for a Script:

Example:

PowerShell script to list all installed software

Bash command to check disk usage in /var

Strict Rules:

Do not request scripts that delete, modify, or access any userâ€™s personal files or folders.

Requests should be focused on safe, administrative operations.

Automated Safeguards:

If a request could impact user data or device security, the assistant will decline to provide a script and explain the reason.
